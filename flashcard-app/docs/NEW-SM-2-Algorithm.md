# **Anki's Modified SM-2 Algorithm: Technical Deep Dive**

## **1. Introduction**

This document outlines the logic behind the Spaced Repetition System (SRS) used in our application. We utilize a **Modified SM-2 Algorithm** (specifically based on Anki's V2 scheduler).

While the original SuperMemo-2 (SM-2) algorithm was developed in the late 1980s to optimize human memory retention, Anki introduced several practical modifications to better suit modern software usage, specifically regarding "Learning" phases and button inputs.

## **2. Core Concepts**

### **2.1 The Two Phases**

The algorithm treats cards differently based on their phase. This distinction is critical for implementation.

1. **Learning Phase (Short-term Memory):**
   - The goal is to move a card from "Unknown" to "Known".
   - Intervals are short (minutes/hours) and fixed.
   - The "Algorithm" (exponential math) **does not apply here**.
   - Cards move linearly through a queue of "Steps".
2. **Review Phase (Long-term Memory):**
   - The goal is to maintain the memory efficiently.
   - Intervals are long (days/years) and calculated mathematically.
   - The "Algorithm" is fully active.

### **2.2 Key Metrics**

- **Ease Factor (EF):** A floating-point number (default 2.5). It represents the "stickiness" of the memory.
  - Higher EF = Slower forgetting = Intervals grow faster.
  - Lower EF = Faster forgetting = Intervals grow slower.
  - _Constraint:_ EF never drops below 1.3 (130%).
- **Interval (I):** The number of days until the next review.

## **3. The Mathematics (Review Phase)**

Once a card graduates from the Learning Phase, its next interval is determined by the user's rating (Again, Hard, Good, Easy).

### **3.1 The "Good" Button (Standard Interaction)**

This is the baseline behavior. When a user presses "Good", we assume the Difficulty (Ease Factor) is accurate.

$$
I_{new} = I_{current} \times EF
$$

- **Logic:** If you remembered a card for 10 days with an Ease Factor of 2.5, you will likely remember it for $10 \times 2.5 = 25$ days next time.
- **Effect on Ease:** None. The Ease Factor remains unchanged.

### **3.2 The "Easy" Button (Bonus)**

Used when the answer was recalled instantly. We reward the user with a larger jump in time and a permanent increase in the card's ease.

$$
I_{new} = I_{current} \times EF \times \text{EasyBonus}
$$

- **Standard Easy Bonus:** 1.3 (130%)
- **Effect on Ease:**  
  $$EF_{new} = EF_{current} + 0.15$$

### **3.3 The "Hard" Button (Penalty)**

Used when the user struggled but succeeded. We slow down the expansion of the interval and permanently decrease the card's ease.

$$
I_{new} = I_{current} \times 1.2
$$

- **Logic:** The interval grows by a flat 20% (1.2x) instead of the usual Ease Factor (typically 2.5x).
- **Effect on Ease:**
  $$
  EF_{new} = \max(1.3,\, EF_{current} - 0.15)
  $$

### **3.4 The "Again" Button (Failure)**

Used when the user forgot the card. The card is penalized heavily.

1. **Lapse:** The card enters the **Relearning** status.
2. **Ease Penalty:**
   $$
   EF_{new} = \max(1.3,\, EF_{current} - 0.20)
   $$
3. **Interval Reset:** The card returns to short-term learning steps (e.g., 10 minutes).
4. **Future Interval:** Once relearned, the new interval is a percentage of the _old_ interval (often 0% or 10% in default Anki settings, effectively resetting progress).

## **4. Anki Deviations from Standard SM-2**

It is important to note where our logic differs from the academic SM-2 paper.

| Feature              | Standard SM-2                                       | Anki Modified (V2)                                                    |
| :------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Initial Steps**    | Fixed: 1 day, then 6 days.                          | Configurable Learning Steps (e.g., 1m, 10m).                          |
| **Rating Scale**     | 0 to 5 (6 options).                                 | 1 to 4 (Again, Hard, Good, Easy).                                     |
| **"Hard" Response**  | treated as passing (grade 3), but resets interval.  | Passes, but grows interval slowly (1.2x) and reduces Ease.            |
| **Ease Calculation** | Complex polynomial formula updated on every review. | Simplified updates (+0.15, 0.0, -0.15, -0.20) based on button choice. |

## **5. Advanced Mechanics**

### **5.1 Fuzz (Input Noise)**

To prevent "clumping"—where 50 cards introduced on Monday all become due on the same Friday—a small random factor is added to the calculated interval.

- **Mechanism:** A random percentage (e.g., ±5%) is applied to the final calculated days.
- **Impact:** Intervals might be 9, 10, or 11 days instead of exactly 10.

### **5.2 Late Reviews**

If a user reviews a card 5 days late, we do not punish them by calculating the next interval based on the _original_ due date. We credit the extra time.

- **Logic:** If you were supposed to see it in 10 days, but saw it in 15 and still remembered, your memory is stronger than predicted.
- **Formula (Simplified):**
  $$
  I_{new} = (I_{scheduled} + \frac{\text{DaysLate}}{2}) \times EF
  $$
